  * Install ca-certificates as well as apt-transport-https for HTTPS
    installations.  This makes it possible to copy certificates that were
    built into the installer to /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ and thus
    have them continue to be trusted after installation.

  * Policy version 3.9.5: no changes required.
  * Install apt-transport-https if installing from an HTTPS mirror
    (LP: #1135163).  It may still be necessary to copy certificates into
    place, but there's at least a reasonable chance that somebody installing
    from HTTPS may want to keep using it, and we have to install
    apt-transport-https at this point otherwise they won't be able to do
    that end-to-end.

  * When deboostrapping Debian, and the debian-archive-keyring is not
    available, switch the default mirror to a https url. This way at
    least the CA level of security is available even for users who
    have no way to check gpg keys in the WoT. The https mirror is
    currently https://mirrors.kernel.org/debian.

    copy all the translations over from base-installer, and it just doesn't
    seem worth it, so lose the cruft (LP: #188690).
  * Export PATH, just to make sure. It isn't necessarily exported by shells
    running from init=/bin/sh or similar, and the upstream bash maintainer

debootstrap (1.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Frans Pop ]
  * Change Priority for the udeb to extra in line with overrides file.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Partially revert r50134; there are people who depend on being able to
    use the "upstream" Makefile on non-Debian systems. Create necessary
    directories in the Makefile rather than relying on dh_installdirs to do
    it (LP: #172645).
  * Use ftp.us.debian.org rather than ftp.debian.org
    (http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/12/msg00002.html).

  [ Anthony Towns ]

    its dependencies) instead of all of base. (Closes: Bug#351912,

    inconsistency.

  * Make pkgdetails.c not need C99 extensions. (Closes: Bug#398977)
  * Fix am_doing_phase implementation in debootstrap script. Thanks to
    Tero Janka for spotting the problem and the fix. (Closes: Bug#409881)

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Drop support for sarge from the udeb.
  * Update README.Debian:
    - One todo item is done. (I think cross-strap is too, but unsure.)
    - Reword NMU policy to note that it's team-maintained now.
  * ACK my prior NMU. Closes: #418600
  * If /dev/MAKEDEV DNE, as on certain s390 machines, use /sbin/MAKEDEV.
    Closes: #420908
    Note that /dev/MAKEDEV is still the correct location, and is still tried
    first so that building works on all FHS systems, as noted in #190239.

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Add support for Ubuntu dapper (Closes: #342838), edgy, feisty, and
    gutsy. Exclude everything but gutsy from the udeb.
  * Fix "deboostrap" typo in debootstrap(8) (thanks, Adam Conrad).
  * Fix "htp" typo in temporary /etc/apt/sources.list.
  * Drop support for woody from the udeb too.
  * When removing $TARGET/debootstrap, debootstrap.log is still open as
    stdout/stderr and needs to remain so, but after unlinking it some NFS
    servers implement this by a temporary file in the same directory, which
    makes it impossible to rmdir that directory. Moving it instead works
    around the problem (thanks, Steven McCoy;
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/65003).
  * Fix formatting error in debootstrap(8) (.R is not a macro).
  * Reorganise scripts into scripts/debian/ and scripts/ubuntu/ directories
    in the source tree to declutter the top level.
  * Add default_mirror function; reorganise the debootstrap script a little
    so that it works. Set the default mirror for Ubuntu suites to
    http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu, and the default mirror for Debian
    etch/lenny/sid architectures other than amd64 and i386 to
    http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian (per ajt; see bug #363049).
  * Add devices created by fd to devices-std.tar.gz, so that
    /dev/std{in,out,err} is available conveniently in chroots with /proc and
    /dev/pts mounted (thanks, Matthias Klose).
  * Document --keyring and --make-tarball. (Closes: #368988)
  * Update Ubuntu mirrors: warty/hoary/breezy => old-releases.ubuntu.com,
    unsupported architectures => ports.ubuntu.com.
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Bump to 1.0.0. Nobody uses debootstrap in production, do they?

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * Remove the extended package description (aka bloat) from the udeb.

    Zimmerman for the analysis.  "Sometimes, dpkg finishes executing before
    smallyes runs, and it loops forever while echo fails repeatedly due to the
    broken pipe."  To fix this race, we simply swap the loop condition and
    body, so that if the echo fails, smallyes() exits cleanly.  I further
    changed "true" to ":" to save the expense of an extra process for shells
    where "true" is not a built-in.

  * Don't use "export foo=bar" on a single line since it's a bashism.

  * Made the "smallyes" usage independent of --boot-floppies. Too much
    code duplication otherwise.

    iptables on arches that have 2.4.x kernels by default. Some arches

  * Workaround for /dev/initctl was never needed and stupid, so removed.

  * Use any "main" components found in Release file, eg "main",
    "non-US/main", "local/main". (Closes: Bug#116801)

debootstrap (0.1.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do progress indications (by bytes) for Packages downloads and .deb
    downloads. (Closes: Bug#101886)
  * Don't use seq. Silly busybox.
  * Add pppoe to base. (Closes: Bug#102378)
  * No point keeping around the "sid.is-broken" file.

debootstrap (0.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make in_target_nofail kill stderr. No more "/dev/pts: not mounted" error.
    Yay. :)

  * Refactor woody, potato and slink scripts; do away with
    woody.debs. Change the way the scripts work. (Now they define
    functions which debootstrap calls. Much nicer)
  * Support --download-only option.
  * Support resuming downloads of Release and Packages files, even gzipped
    ones.
  * Support null: (Packages files assumed to be named for a debootstrap.invalid
    host)
  * Always use the deboostrap.invalid name, and use that in
    /etc/apt/sources.list. Remove /etc/apt/sources.list after the base
    system is build.
  * All this should be enough to support basedeb.tgz installs on
    debootstrap's behalf. Some more stuff would be useful, but isn't
    immediately necessary. (Closes: Bug#102217)

  * Add ia64 support and fix libc6 == libc6.1 problem. (Closes: Bug#101829)

  * Be a little more careful with permissions on devs tarball. Hopefully.
    (Closes: Bug#102308)

  * Don't worry if md5sum from stdin adds a "  -" after the md5sum. Should
    make debootstrap more usable on non-Debian Linuxes.

debootstrap (0.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add symlink for sid.debs.
  * Fix the special casing for hppa. (Closes: Bug#101604)
  * Remove groff from base. (Closes: Bug#101173)
  * Retry partially successful downloads a couple of times.
    (Closes: Bug#101476)
  * Minor wording changes wrt downloading Release file (Closes: Bug#101705)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Thu, 21 Jun 2001 12:08:10 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.12) unstable; urgency=high

  * Split determination of base into a separate script to enable further
    innovation! Come on, tell me that doesn't excite you!

  * Add groff-base to base. (Closes: Bug#100112, Bug#100123)
  * Remove libstdc++2.10 and some other hopefully unnecessary debs
    (Closes: Bug#99708)

  * Remove lilo.conf special casing. Change some warnings to info messages.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sun, 10 Jun 2001 01:22:12 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add dhcp-client to base. (Closes: Bug#100083)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sat,  9 Jun 2001 00:11:26 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't abort build on devfs systems: the makedev we build-dep on should
    be recent enough. (Closes: Bug#97713)
  * Check for malformed release files. Thanks to Martin Michlmayr for the
    patch. (Closes: Bug#97707)
  * Use --force-confold when installing base. That is: if you want the
    conffile from the package to be there at the end, don't create a
    file in the first place. I'm not convinced this is right.
    (Closes: Bug#99025)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Mon, 28 May 2001 14:43:07 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Abort build on devfs systems (MAKEDEV fails for no good reason)
    (Closes: Bug#97713)

  * Add support for mips and mipsel (Closes: Bug#97711)
  * Add some support for hppa (install palo in base)

  * Don't install ldso (Closes: Bug#97708)
  * Don't install libopenldap1 or libopenldap-runtime (replaced by libldap2)
    (Closes: Bug#98050)
  * Do install libdb3 and libcap1.
  * Install klogd too. (But only as part of base. Move sysklogd to base too)

  * Setup a dummy lilo.conf on i386 only. (Closes: Bug#97710, Bug#98052)

  * Trim a trailing / for target and url.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sun, 20 May 2001 13:33:34 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add adduser and base-config into base. base-config unfortunately depends
    on perl instead of perl-base. (Closes: Bug#96439)
  * Force LANG=C. Need to work out how i18n should be handled.
  * Kludge potato install so it's noninteractive. Thanks to Colin Watson
    for the patch. (Closes: Bug#94441)
  * Get rid of dh_testversion.
  * Make a sid script (just a symlink to the woody script).

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Wed,  9 May 2001 20:33:00 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't worry if umounting /dev/pts fails.
  * Add debootstrap(8) manpage, thanks to Matt Kraai. (Closes: Bug#86238)
  * Add a blank line to the end of the faked /var/lib/dpkg/status. Spotted
    by Richard Hirst.
  * Added console-tools and console-data into the base system.
  * Move /etc/exim.conf to /etc/exim/exim.conf so that sendmail doesn't
    give errors, even if debconf tries to use it before exim is
    configured.  Gack.
  * Add fdutils back into base.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Mon, 30 Apr 2001 15:49:27 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Only create stuff in /etc if it hasn't already been created.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Mon, 23 Apr 2001 18:02:55 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use "head -n X" instead of "head -X" to work with busybox.
    (Closes: Bug#94575)
  * Use s///I instead of s///i for case insensitivity, again for busybox.
    (Closes: Bug#94579)
  * Fixed typo that would have stopped debootstrap from falling back to an
    uncompressed Packages file.
  * Added libsasl7 and libldap2 to woody base, since woody exim now depends
    on them.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sun, 22 Apr 2001 01:47:00 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * If we've got a Release file, check that the Packages files we download
    have the right md5sums.
  * Build-Depend on new makedev, and don't hax0r powerpc devices as much.
    (Closes: Bug#93836)
  * Hopefully support arm chroots. (Closes: Bug#92592) Declare it to be
    Arch: any, and see what dies. There's a chance that nothing will. Not
    a *big* chance, but a chance.
  * Fiddled with the base system some more. Added apt-utils so
    preconfiguration will work.
  * Added permission to NMU to the README.Debian.
  * Mention file:/ URLs in README.Debian. (Closes: Bug#87099)
  * Add a --boot-floppies option that changes the way the I/O happens, in
    a way that's hopefully useful for boot-floppies. See README.Debian for
    details.
  * Also added a bit more output.

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Mon, 26 Mar 2001 22:30:12 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Switch from debconf-tiny to debconf, since that's what's now in
    woody. (Using debconf-tiny probably makes the package unusable, hence
    the urgency) Fixup perl, lilo and console-apt to cope with changes in
    the base system in woody. Added ae, left nano and nvi.
  * Add support for m68k, sparc and powerpc, based on Christian Steigies
    patches and Adam Di Carlo's NMU (Closes: Bug#89883, Bug#91221)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sun, 25 Mar 2001 14:29:02 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add support for slink.
  * Fix support for woody (no lilo, console-*, different perl)
  * Re-download Packages files every time (Closes: Bug#88438)
    (Should this be changed to re-download things where the md5 doesn't match?)

 -- Anthony Towns <aj@azure.humbug.org.au>  Sun,  4 Mar 2001 19:42:29 +1000

debootstrap (0.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial Release. (Closes: Bug#82245)

  * Called it debootstrap instead of debchroot, because it's more about
    bootstrapping a Debian environment, whether that will end up being
    in a chroot, or as a standalone system. Blame Adam di Carlo. :)
