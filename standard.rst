The Subuser Standard
====================

These documents standardize the data serialized by programs implementing the subuser standard.

This standard is organized in order from most stable to least stable.  The format for strings used to identify image sources will most likely never change.  The format used for packaging and sharing subuser images will evolve over time, however after the 1.0 version of the standard backwards compatibility will be kept at all costs.  The internal serialization format of the subuser program will also evolve over time, perhaps in non-backwards compatible ways.
