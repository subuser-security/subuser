 * Every program should have a description and a maintainer.

 * While a program may have a dependency in order to conserve space, always err on the side of reliability.  If there is a risk of a version conflict then keep your program self contained.

 * When using the `FROM` command, you must not build your docker-image off a user uploaded image(even a verified one) you can only build off the official docker images.

 * When a "program" does not declare an executable(aka, its only purpose is to provide a base image from which other programs are built) that program's name should be prefixed with the string "lib"

Contributing code to the repository:
------------------------------------

 * One of the major aims of this project is to be as easy to install as possible while still maintaining a maintainable code base.  For this reason, I have chosen to aim for compatibility with all python versions later than 2.7 including the 3.x range.  Furthermore, there are to be NO EXTERNAL DEPENDENCIES!

 * Do not maintain 80 collumn code formatting.  Any pull requests to refill to 80 collumns will be rejected.  Refilling is based on some meaningless and ancient standard.  I often use 60 collumn terminals which make 80 collumns hard to read, it is far easier to read line wrapped code that is of its natural length then to read line-wrapped filled code.

 * Before writting comments read this article: http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/

 * Follow the projects indent style for blocks.

 * Tabs are forbidden.

 * Use human readable names for things.

 * Do not shorten words/leave out vowels.

   + There are a few cases in which I have used shortened versions of things: dir, arg.  These are cases where the short version is as widely known as the long version.
